When an online store is set up to enable businesses to buy from another businesses, the process is called\\xA0business-to-business\\xA0(B2B) online shopping. A typical online store enables the customer to browse the firm's range of products and services, view photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and prices. Online stores usually enable shoppers to use \\\"search\\\" features to find specific models, brands or items. Online customers must have access to the Internet and a valid\\xA0method of payment\\xA0in order to complete a transaction, such as a\\xA0credit card, an\\xA0Interac-enabled\\xA0debit card, or a service such as\\xA0PayPal. For physical products (e.g., paperback books or clothes), the e-tailer ships the products to the customer; for digital products, such as\\xA0digital audio files\\xA0of\\xA0songs\\xA0or\\xA0software, the e-tailer usually sends the file to the customer over the Internet.
